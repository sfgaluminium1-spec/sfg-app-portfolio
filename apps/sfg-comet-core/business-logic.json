  "description": "SFG COMET CORE is the central orchestration hub for SFG Aluminium's business operations, serving as the primary desktop and document management system. Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, it integrates with five specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers via AgentPass.ai for Sales, Finance, Operations, Communications, and Data management. The system features a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Truth System powered by ChromaDB and PostgreSQL, storing all business rules and logic in a vector database for AI-queryable intelligence. COMET CORE manages the complete project lifecycle through six stages (New Enquiry, Viability Check, Pre-Production, Production, Final Inspection, Invoicing) with automated document numbering, anti-drift protection, and comprehensive audit logging. It provides real-time credit checking via Companies House and Experian integration, tier-based staff permissions (Tier 1-3 access control), and seamless integration with external systems including Xero accounting, Microsoft Graph for SharePoint/Outlook, Gmail, and Twilio SMS. The application serves as the single source of truth for all SFG Aluminium operations, orchestrating data flow between satellite applications and maintaining centralized business intelligence.",
